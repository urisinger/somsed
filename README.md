# Somsed

A **high-performance compiler and client** for Desmos(written in rust), designed to speed up graph rendering and computation by jit compiling expressions to native code using inkwell.

# Plans 
Gpu execution engine for graph rendering
(maybe) AST level optimization
## Usage  

1. Start the client:  
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
