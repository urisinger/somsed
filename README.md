A **high-performance compiler and client** for Desmos(written in rust ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘‘ðŸ¦€).

# Planned features
- [x] basic statments, function calls and variables
- [x] native compilation
- [x] list types
- [ ] wack scopes 
- [ ] not leaking memory with list types
- [ ] more advanced functions and operators
- [ ] conditionals

## Usage  

1. Start the client:

the client looks and functions quite simular to desmos, but expressions are parsed in their raw latex form.
